This project is a production SaaS application (Formactive / FormFlow) focused on high-conversion UX and polished UI.

For all designs, prioritize:
- Clear marketing hierarchy (hero → problem → solution → proof → CTA)
- Conversion-focused copy (concise, benefit-driven, non-generic)
- Professional, premium SaaS aesthetic (similar quality to Formless, Linear, Stripe)
- Pages should feel investor-ready and customer-ready, not like a demo.

All pages must be fully featured, production-worthy, and visually refined — not cookie-cutter.

Technical rules:
- When using client-side hooks (useState, useEffect) in components treated as Server Components by Next.js, always add "use client" at the top of the file.
- Do not write code that triggers hydration warnings such as: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s".
- Use JSX with Tailwind CSS classes.
- Use shadcn/ui components and lucide-react icons.
- Do not install additional UI libraries unless explicitly requested.

Design intent:
- Favor simplicity over cleverness.
- Prefer realistic SaaS layouts over experimental UI.
- Marketing sections may use mock or static data if functionality is not required.
