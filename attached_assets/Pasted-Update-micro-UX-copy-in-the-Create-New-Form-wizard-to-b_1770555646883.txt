Update micro-UX copy in the “Create New Form” wizard to be travel-industry universal (not only “trip requests”). It should work equally well for: trips, group travel, events/retreats, weddings, corporate travel, concierge requests, partnerships, venue/hotel inquiries, etc.

Scope constraints:

* Text-only changes (labels, helper text, empty states, button text, preview headings, toast copy).
* Do NOT change layout, schema, database calls, routes, or step logic.
* Keep existing split-pane builder and deterministic preview behavior.

Voice:

* Travel-professional, warm and confident (advisor/organizer vibe).
* Avoid narrow words like “trip request”, “getaway”, “destination” in global UI unless the selected template specifically uses them.
* Prefer neutral terms: “request”, “inquiry”, “experience”, “event”, “plan”, “details”, “preferences”.

Apply these copy adjustments (or closest equivalents if strings differ):

Global / Stepper

* “Create a conversational intake” -> “Create a conversational request”
* Global subtitle -> “Collect the right details through a guided conversation — for trips, groups, events, and more.”
* Wherever it says “client preview” -> “Guest preview” (more universal for travel)

Step 1 (Basics)

* “Internal name” helper -> “Only you see this in your dashboard.”
* If there’s any “Trip request” default name -> change default to “New request” (or “New inquiry”) unless a template explicitly sets it.
* Disabled Next hint -> “Add an internal name to continue.”

Step 2 (Questions)

* Title -> “What should we ask?”
* Subtext -> “We’ll ask these one at a time — like a quick consultation.”
* Question placeholder -> “e.g. What are you planning?”
* Helper text helper -> “Shown under the question to guide the guest.”
* Example answer helper -> “Used only for the preview.”
* “Must be answered” keep.
* Preview header -> “Live guest preview”
* Preview subtext -> “This is exactly what your guest will see.”

Step 3 (Tone & branding)

* Title -> “Set your tone & branding”
* Subtext -> “Make the conversation feel like your service.”
* Company name helper -> “Shown to guests during the conversation.”
* Contact email helper -> “Guests can use this if they need help.”
* “Brand color” helper -> “Used for buttons and highlights.”
* Logo helper -> “Optional — displayed at the top of the conversation.”
* Tone card descriptions:

  * Professional -> “Clear, confident, consultation-style”
  * Friendly (Recommended badge) -> “Warm, welcoming, easy to answer”
  * Luxury -> “Polished, elevated, premium experience”

Step 4 (Review)

* Title -> “Ready to share?”
* Subtext -> “Quick check before you send it out.”
* CTA -> “Create request” (instead of “Create intake”)
* Loading -> “Creating…”

Also update any landing/preview greeting lines inside `components/chat-preview.tsx` (or equivalent) to avoid trip-specific language:

* Replace “plan your perfect getaway” / “Where are you dreaming of going?” with something neutral like:
  “Hi! I’ll ask a few quick questions so we can help you with your request.”
  First question should mirror the selected template’s first question.

Acceptance:

* TypeScript passes.
* Only copy changes.
* Summarize which strings were changed and where.
