You are building a web app page that functions as a “Conversational Form Builder” editor (similar to Formless by Typeform). The page is a single-workspace editor for one conversation project, combining: (1) a rules/prompt editor for an AI conversation, (2) welcome/end screen configuration, (3) data extraction schema generation, (4) visuals + training panels, and (5) publish/share/test controls.

## Overall layout (UX + IA)

* Use a **dashboard shell** with a **top navigation header** and a **left/secondary nav** or tab bar.
* Primary navigation items: **Editor**, **Conversations**, and an **Analytics** link for the current project.
* The main view is a **two-column layout**:

  * **Left column (configuration panels)**: stacked collapsible sections for setup.
  * **Right column (live preview)**: a device-like preview of the conversational experience with a “Test instructions” button and a small “Runs on…” branding footer.

## Key sections and functionality

### 1) “Instruct the AI” (Prompt/Rules Editor)

* A prominent section labeled **“Instruct the AI”** with helper text: “Define in detail & in plain language the rules of the conversation…”
* Include:

  * A **multiline textarea** for the AI instructions (hard character limit visible, e.g., “1500 characters left”).
  * A **“Quick start prompts”** button that inserts or suggests templates.
* Technical expectations:

  * Store prompt text in state, autosave with debounce.
  * Show remaining characters and prevent overflow.
  * Support versioning or draft state indicator (optional).

### 2) “Welcome & end screen” configuration

* A section with a toggle: **“Your Welcome Screen is currently hidden”** + **Enable** button.
* Fields:

  * **Title & welcome statement**: one single-line input (title) + one multiline textarea (welcome message) with character counter (e.g., 250).
  * **Language selector** (e.g., 🇬🇧 en) dropdown to localize the welcome content.
  * **Call to action** input for the welcome button label.
  * **End screen redirect button** with a checkbox toggle and optional redirect URL field when enabled.
* UX:

  * Disabled/hidden state clearly shown.
  * When enabled, fields animate in and become editable.

### 3) Data extraction (Schema)

* A section labeled **“Data extraction”** showing “0 items” when empty.
* Explanation: auto-generated data schema based on the “Instruct the AI” prompt.
* Include:

  * A JSON-like schema editor area (monospace) showing `{}` by default.
  * An **“Auto Generate”** button that creates a schema from the prompt (simulate with a mock API).
* Technical:

  * Schema stored as JSON, validated with inline errors.
  * Auto-generate calls an endpoint and updates the schema editor.
  * Extracted items list is derived from schema keys.

### 4) Visuals panel

* Collapsible section **“Visuals”** with status (“Open”).
* Placeholder for theme settings:

  * Colors, avatar/illustration, background, typography, maybe a logo upload.
* Technical:

  * Persist settings per conversation project.
  * Preview updates live.

### 5) “Train the AI” panel

* Collapsible section **“Train the AI”** with status (“Open”).
* Purpose: upload examples/FAQs, add knowledge snippets, or test conversation behavior.
* Technical:

  * Provide a simple dataset list with add/edit/remove.
  * Mock endpoints for training data persistence.

## Top-right actions (primary controls)

* A primary CTA button: **“Publish formless”** that publishes the current project.
* Below/near it: a shareable public URL (e.g., [https://formless.ai/c/](https://formless.ai/c/)<id>).
* Buttons for **Share** and **Refresh**; include a small usage badge like “1x”.

## Right-side live preview

* A preview card showing:

  * The current welcome title (“Hello hiiiii” in the example).
  * A **“Test instructions”** button that runs a test chat session using the current prompt + settings.
  * Branding footer “Runs on… Formless”.
* Technical:

  * Preview reads from the same state store as the editor.
  * “Test instructions” triggers a simulated chat run (mock streaming responses).

## Technical implementation requirements

* Frontend: React + TypeScript, modern component system.
* State: central store per conversation (e.g., Zustand/Redux) with autosave debounce.
* Backend: REST endpoints (or server actions) for:

  * GET/PUT conversation config (prompt, welcome/end settings, visuals, training items)
  * POST generate-schema from prompt
  * POST publish
  * GET public link metadata
* Validation:

  * Character counters enforced client-side.
  * JSON schema validation with user-friendly errors.
* UX polish:

  * Collapsible sections with clear headings and helper text.
  * Disabled states + tooltips for unavailable items.
  * Toast notifications for save/publish/generate actions.
  * Loading spinners on schema generation and publish.
