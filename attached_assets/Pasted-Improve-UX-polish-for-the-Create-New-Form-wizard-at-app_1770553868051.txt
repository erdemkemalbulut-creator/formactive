Improve UX polish for the “Create New Form” wizard at app/dashboard/forms/new/page.tsx (Next.js App Router + shadcn/ui). Scope is strictly UI/UX polish + light state/validation. Do not change database schema or API routes.

Primary goal:
Implement a split-pane builder (left editor / right preview) ONLY for:

Step 2: Questions

Step 3: Brand & tone
Keep Step 1 and Step 4 single-column.

Hard requirements:

Split-pane layout (Step 2 & 3 only)

Desktop: 2 columns (left editor, right preview).

Mobile: stack (editor first, preview collapsible under it).

Keep existing Next/Back wizard behavior and state persistence.

Preview must match the real product UI

The right pane should reuse or visually match the existing “public conversational form/chat” components/styles (do not invent a new look).

Preview is deterministic + read-only (no persistence, no AI).

Shows ONLY the current question and an input matching field type (text/email/number/select/date/boolean).

Live-updates as the user edits:

Step 2: question text + helper text + example answer

Step 3: company name, logo URL preview, primary color, tone

Navigation polish

On step change, smooth scroll to top.

Disable Next when required fields are invalid for that step.

Show clear inline hint near the Next button explaining what’s missing (not just a toast).

Brand & tone (Step 3) polish

Tone options (Professional/Friendly/Luxury) as accessible selectable cards:

clear selected state

keyboard accessible (Enter/Space)

proper aria-pressed / aria-selected

“Recommended” badge on Friendly (default)

Company name + Contact email required:

inline validation + helper text

contact email format validation

Logo URL:

show small image preview if valid

non-blocking hint if invalid

Primary color:

keep hex input + color picker synced

show small preview chip

Keep changes minimal

Prefer adding a small ChatPreview component under components/ and importing it into the page.

Avoid broad refactors; only touch files needed.

No new libraries.

Acceptance checklist (must pass):

TypeScript builds with no errors.

Step 2 & 3 show split-pane + live preview.

Next button gating works with inline hints.

Preview visually matches existing chat UI.
