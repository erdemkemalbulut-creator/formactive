Tighten micro-UX copy in the “Create New Form” wizard to feel like a modern travel advisor tool (warm, expert, reassuring). Scope: text-only changes (labels, helper text, button text, empty states). Do NOT change layout, schema, API routes, or validation logic.

Where:

app/dashboard/forms/new/page.tsx

components/chat-preview.tsx (and any small related UI components)

Voice guidelines:

Sound like a professional travel advisor: warm, confident, service-oriented.

Avoid jargon like “schema/field/required”. Use human phrasing.

Reduce anxiety: clarify what clients will see vs what’s dashboard-only.

Keep sentences short and clear.

Apply these copy updates (or equivalent where exact strings differ):

Global

“Create New Form” -> “Create a conversational intake”

Subtitle -> “Collect trip details naturally — like a great first consultation.”

Step 1 (Basics)

Form name label -> “Internal name”
Helper -> “Only you see this in your dashboard.”

If there’s a public-facing title, label -> “Client-facing title”
Helper -> “This appears at the top of the conversation.”

Disabled Next hint -> “Add an internal name to continue.”

Step 2 (Questions)

Section title -> “What should we ask your client?”
Subtext -> “We’ll ask these one at a time — just like a quick consultation.”

“Question text” -> “Question”
Placeholder -> “e.g. Where would you love to go?”

“Help text (optional)” helper -> “Shown under the question to guide your client.”

“Example answer (optional)” helper -> “Used only for the preview.”

“Required” toggle label -> “Must be answered”

“Add another question” button -> “Add a question”

Any generic “Continue” -> “Next: Review questions”

Preview (right pane)

Header -> “Live client preview”
Subtext -> “This is exactly what your client will see.”

Step 3 (Brand & tone)

Title -> “Set your tone & branding”
Subtext -> “Make the conversation feel like your brand.”

Company name helper -> “Shown to clients during the conversation.”

“Primary color” -> “Brand color”
Helper -> “Used for buttons and highlights.”

Logo helper -> “Optional — displayed at the top of the conversation.”
Invalid logo hint -> “We couldn’t load that image.”

Contact email helper -> “Clients can use this if they need help.”
Email error -> “Enter a valid email address.”

Tone cards (travel advisor feel)

Professional -> “Clear, confident, consultation-style”

Friendly (Recommended badge) -> “Warm, welcoming, easy to answer”

Luxury -> “Polished, elevated, premium experience”

Step 4 (Review)

Title -> “Ready to share?”
Subtext -> “Quick check before you send it to clients.”

Final CTA -> “Create intake”
Loading -> “Creating…”
