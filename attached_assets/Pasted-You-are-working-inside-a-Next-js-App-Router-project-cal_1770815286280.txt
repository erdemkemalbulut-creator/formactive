You are working inside a Next.js (App Router) project called **formactive**.

Goal: make this an **internal-only** product with an extremely clean UX. Remove all commercial/billing/profile surfaces.

Implement this exact flow:
**Landing (/) → Sign in (/signin) → Dashboard (/dashboard) → Sign out → back to Landing (/)**

Brand:

* Text logo only: **formactive** (lowercase)
* Bold, modern, rounded feel (clean typography, rounded corners)
* Minimal UI, lots of whitespace

Landing page (app/page.tsx):

* Very minimal, Formless-inspired
* Show logo + one headline + one short subline + a single primary button: **Sign in**
* Messaging must clearly say: **AI-powered conversational forms (Formless-style)**
* No pricing, no billing, no “upgrade”, no marketing sections, no footer clutter

Copy suggestion:
Headline: “AI conversational forms that ask and adapt.”
Subline: “Create Formless-style chat forms to collect structured answers.”
Button: “Sign in”

Auth:

* Create /signin page if it doesn’t exist
* After sign-in success, redirect to **/dashboard**
* If user is not signed in and visits /dashboard, redirect to **/**

Dashboard (app/dashboard/page.tsx):

* No “My Profile” page
* No billing/plan UI
* Top bar:

  * Left: logo “formactive” (links to /dashboard)
  * Right: show user email address + **Sign out** button
* Main content: **Forms list only**

  * Title: “Forms”
  * Button: “+ New form”
  * List or grid of forms (simple cards is fine)
* Nothing else in the nav

Sign out:

* Clear session
* Redirect to “/”
* Landing page is shown

Cleanup:

* Remove/disable any routes/components referencing billing, subscriptions, upgrades, plans, usage limits, account settings, or profile pages.
* Remove any “Upgrade” buttons/links/logic.
* Keep only auth + forms list + dashboard + sign out.

Deliverable:

* Make the necessary code edits in the relevant files (app/page.tsx, app/signin/page.tsx if needed, app/dashboard/page.tsx, shared layout/components).
* Ensure the flow works end-to-end.
