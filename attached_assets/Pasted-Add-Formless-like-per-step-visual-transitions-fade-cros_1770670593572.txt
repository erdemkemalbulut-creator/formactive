Add Formless-like per-step visual transitions (fade / cross-dissolve) when moving between steps in the respondent experience.

Goal:

* When the active step changes (welcome -> step 1 -> step 2 ... -> end), the background visual should cross-dissolve smoothly.
* The text/question + input should also fade/slide subtly, but the key is the background transition.

Scope:

* Public respondent page (/f/[slug]) and the preview renderer should both show the transition.
* Do NOT reintroduce cards or chat UI.
* Keep preview inputs inert.

Implementation requirements:

1. Cross-dissolve background media:

* Render two background layers (previous and next).
* On step change, set the next layer to the new background, fade it in while fading the previous out.
* After transition completes, unmount the old layer.
* Duration: ~350–600ms.
* Use CSS transitions (opacity) or a small animation helper.
* Support:

  * image -> image
  * image -> none (gradient)
  * none -> image
  * video -> video
  * video -> image
  * image -> video
* For video:

  * Ensure autoplay muted loop playsInline continues.
  * Avoid flashing black frames; pre-load next video element before fading in.

2. Transition the foreground content:

* On step change, fade out the current question container and fade in the next.
* Keep it subtle (opacity + small translateY like 6–10px).
* Ensure the typewriter animation restarts after the content fade-in completes.

3. Respect reduced motion:

* If prefers-reduced-motion is enabled, disable animations (instant switch).

4. Preview behavior:

* Still editor-driven (no progression), but when previewStepIndex changes because I click a different step, the same cross-dissolve should run.

Files likely to modify:

* app/f/[slug]/page.tsx (background wrapper/canvas)
* components/conversational-form.tsx (foreground transition + typewriter timing)
* any background media component you created

Deliverable:

* Smooth cross-fade background transitions between steps.
* No flicker, no layout jump.
* Foreground question fades nicely and typewriter restarts cleanly.
