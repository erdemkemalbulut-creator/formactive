Goal: Replace the card-based question UI with a cinematic, full-screen, Formless-style question renderer.

Context:

* The current renderer shows questions inside a centered card.
* This must be removed entirely.
* The experience should feel cinematic, minimal, and focused on one question at a time.

Do this:

1. REMOVE THE CARD CONTAINER

* In components/conversational-form.tsx (or equivalent renderer):

  * Remove the card/wrapper component that contains the question + input.
  * Questions should render directly on top of the background (image/video/gradient).
  * Use a subtle background overlay (gradient or scrim) for readability, but no card UI.

2. SINGLE QUESTION, FULL SCREEN

* Render ONLY the active step’s question.
* Do NOT show previous or future steps.
* No chat bubbles.
* No stacked messages.
* No transcript.

3. CINEMATIC TYPING EFFECT FOR QUESTIONS

* Implement a typewriter-style effect for the question text:

  * Characters appear one by one (keyboard-like typing).
  * Slight delay per character (e.g. 20–35ms).
  * Question must fully finish typing before the input becomes active.
* The effect should re-run when:

  * The active step changes (editor preview or live respondent).

4. RESPONSE AREA

* Below the question, show a single input area:

  * Placeholder text: “Type here…”
  * Large, minimal input (no borders or very subtle underline).
  * Input is visually secondary to the question text.
* Input types adapt per question type (text, multiple choice, etc.), but:

  * All inputs appear in the same visual position.
  * No cards, no containers.

5. PREVIEW MODE BEHAVIOR

* In preview/editor mode:

  * Inputs are inert (no submission, no validation).
  * Typing does not advance steps.
  * The preview shows only the currently selected step.
* In live/respondent mode:

  * Step advances ONLY after explicit submit/selection.

6. TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY

* Question text:

  * Very large (hero-level)
  * Strong contrast
* Input text:

  * Smaller
  * Subtle
* Ensure:

  * Welcome title ≫ Question text ≫ Input

Files to modify:

* components/conversational-form.tsx
* Any shared renderer styles or hooks used for step rendering

Constraints:

* Do NOT reintroduce chat UI.
* Do NOT add cards, bubbles, or timelines.
* Do NOT show multiple questions at once.

Done when:

* Questions feel cinematic and immersive.
* The UI matches Formless’s full-screen, minimal style.
* The card is completely gone.
