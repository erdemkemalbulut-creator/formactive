Implement Formless-like “Welcome as Hero” + stronger hierarchy + editor-driven preview-only behavior.
Do NOT change question flow logic for the real respondent page besides the Welcome layout (welcome only). Do NOT reintroduce chat.

GOALS
A) Welcome screen becomes a hero (no card) with big title/subtitle/CTA directly on the background.
B) Stronger typography hierarchy:

* Welcome title much larger than question text
* CTA larger/more prominent than inputs
  C) Preview is editor-driven only:
* In builder preview mode, inputs are inert (no submission, no validation, no saving, no progression). It should only mirror the selected step.
* Public respondent mode remains fully interactive.

SCOPE
Files mainly:

* components/conversational-form.tsx
* app/dashboard/forms/[id]/page.tsx (only if needed to pass preview flags already in place)
* app/f/[slug]/page.tsx (to apply hero welcome on public page too, if welcome is enabled)

---

PART 1 — WELCOME AS HERO (NO CARD)

1. In components/conversational-form.tsx, when rendering the welcome screen:

* Render a hero overlay instead of the card container.
* The hero content should be centered and constrained (max-width ~720px).
* Show, in this order:

  * (optional) avatar/initial
  * BIG title (welcome.title or form title fallback)
  * subtitle/body text (welcome.body or fallback)
  * primary CTA button (welcome.ctaLabel fallback "Start")
  * optional microcopy line (e.g. “Takes about 1 minute”) if you already have a minutes field; otherwise omit.

2. Hero styling requirements:

* Title should be significantly larger than question text (e.g. 48–64px on desktop).
* Subtitle smaller and muted (e.g. 18–22px).
* CTA button larger (height ~52px, generous padding, rounded-pill).
* Add a subtle background vignette overlay behind text to ensure readability (e.g. gradient overlay) but do not add new settings.

3. Questions/steps should remain inside the card as they are today (do not change the question card layout in this part).

---

PART 2 — STRONGER TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY (WELCOME + CTA)

1. Ensure question text size remains smaller than welcome title.
2. Ensure CTA (welcome button) is more prominent than inputs:

* bigger height
* higher contrast using primaryColor
* ensure focus/hover states exist (simple)

Do NOT redesign the entire theme system; just apply these sizes/spacing.

---

PART 3 — PREVIEW IS EDITOR-DRIVEN ONLY (INERT INPUTS)

In builder preview mode (the right panel in /dashboard/forms/[id]):

1. Inputs must be inert:

* Text inputs/textarea should be disabled or readOnly and NOT focusable for typing.
* Choice buttons should not be clickable (disabled).
* Submit/Next controls must be hidden or disabled.
* No validation messages should show.
* No state progression or answer storage should occur in preview mode.

2. Preview should still show the correct UI for the step (so the creator sees the input type), but it should behave like a “mock”.

3. The preview should continue to mirror the currently selected Journey item via previewStepIndex, and show Welcome hero if previewStepIndex is null and welcome enabled.

Public respondent mode:

* Must remain fully interactive.
* Must still submit and progress as before.

Implementation notes:

* Add/ensure a prop like previewMode boolean (already exists in some form) and use it to:

  * render inert inputs
  * hide submission handlers
  * prevent any setState that advances steps

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

* Welcome screen shows as hero (no card) in both builder preview and public respondent flow when on welcome.
* Title is big, subtitle smaller, CTA prominent.
* In builder preview, clicking the input area does nothing and no answers are stored; no progression happens.
* In public form, everything works normally (answers, validation, progression).
* No new settings added.

Execute these changes with minimal, clean diffs and test both preview and public flow.
